        <p><strong>Research areas.</strong> My research focuses on computational immunology and data analysis approaches to understand immune system dynamics. I work on projects that combine experimental data with computational modeling to advance our understanding of immune responses.</p>

        <p><strong>Ongoing work.</strong> Currently, I am involved in research projects at the Allen Institute for Immunology that leverage cutting-edge computational methods to analyze immune system data. This work contributes to our broader understanding of immune function and has potential applications for therapeutic development.</p>

        <p><strong>Future publications.</strong> I am actively working on manuscripts that will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. These publications will showcase the innovative research being conducted at the Allen Institute and my contributions to the field of computational immunology.</p>
